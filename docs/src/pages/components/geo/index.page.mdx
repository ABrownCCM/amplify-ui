Amplify UI Geo provides UI components for maps and location search for popular front end frameworks, powered by
[Amplify Geo APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/geo/getting-started/q/platform/js/) and
[Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/).

## Geocoder

`Geocoder` provides location search powered by [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) for the
`AmplifyMap` component, using the viewport as the proximity for generating results. `Geocoder` is used as a child
component of `AmplifyMap` for which it renders visual markers and information based on its location search results.

### Quick Start

> Preqrequisite: [Create a Geo backend](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/geo/getting-started/q/platform/js/)

You can import the `Geocoder` component with related styles and use it as a child of `AmplifyMap` without any
additional configuration.

<Fragment platforms={['react']}>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./fragments/geocoder-quick-start.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

### Geocoder Position

`Geocoder` can be provided a `position` property when used with `AmplifyMap`. The property is not reactive, meaning the
position is fixed after the component mounts. Valid values are `'top-right'`, `'top-left'`, `'bottom-right'`, and
`'bottom-left'`. Default value is `'top-right'`.

<Fragment platforms={['react']}>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./fragments/geocoder-position.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

### Standalone Geocoder

`Geocoder` can also be used as a standalone component without `AmplifyMap`. As a standalone component, `Geocoder`
provides search results based on an initial proximity. When used as a standlone component, the `proximity` property
with provided `latitude` and `longitude` properties is required.

<Fragment platforms={['react']}>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./fragments/standalone-geocoder.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>
